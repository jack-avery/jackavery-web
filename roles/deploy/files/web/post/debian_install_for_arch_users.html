        In this downtime between jobs and education I've been spending a lot of time learning programming languages and fiddling with Linux,
        so I thought I might as well begin to document my adventures in some sort of publicly-available system. A development blog. Devblog?
        <br>
        <br>
        I've used Windows 11 on my home PC for a long time, but the way that Microsoft is leading Windows with things like Recall leaves a lot to be desired for me.
        I've tried out many distributions of Linux, wondering to myself if it's quite ready yet -- my fondest experiences being with Fedora, and most recently Gentoo.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout all of my time fiddling about with distributions though, I've come to cherish the installation experience that I have when I'm installing Arch or Gentoo.
        Something about having direct, immediate control over everything related to the install via a command line gives me a lot more comfort
        than sitting and waiting for some graphical installer to finish whatever it's doing.
        <br>
        <br>
        It also just so happens that the little laptop I bought for $100 from my local Best Buy refuses to work correctly with graphical installers.
        It's much too slow to be running something like Gentoo (I'm aware Gentoo provides binary repositories now, but that doesn't mean all packages have a binary equivalent),
        and I'm just not a fan of Arch, after trying it multiple times. Bleeding edge just isn't for me.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>So what to do?</strong> ... I did a bit of research (approximately One [1] Startpage search) and discovered <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap">debootstrap</a>,
        and there's <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/varqox/42e213b6b2dde2b636ef">this gist</a> made by varqox over on GitHub that helped me out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Immediately I loaded up my favorite bootloader for installing better operating systems -- the Arch USB installation medium -- and picked up debootstrap from the Arch repositories.
        It's a bit more involved than the Arch install -- requiring you to apt install the kernel image you want, and select your repository -- but it really does feel like I'm right back at home.
        <br>
        <br>
        I tried installing using the Ubuntu repository, assuming that debootstrap had its' own list of required packages to install; but I was proven wrong upon seeing ubuntu-advantage in my installed packages.
        Afterwards, I installed standard Bookworm just to prove to myself it could be done from scratch using debootstrap. All things considered, I think I'll just install Debian this way moving forward.
