        </h2>

        <p>
        a lot of my friends have expressed desire to swap to linux. with the end of Windows 10 support nearing and Windows 11 continuing downhill,
        linux continues to offer itself as a perfect alternative for anyone wishing for a system that respects them.
        <br>
        <br>
        i'm pretty much the only person in any of my friend groups that actually uses linux daily (i have now been using NixOS as a primary system for over a month),
        and i feel obligated to provide some information off-the-bat to everyone interested where there may be lacking some basic explanations online.
        <br>
        <br>
        this page serves as a way for me to share my information to anyone who might be interested in making the move to linux.

        <h2 id="packagemanagers">
        1. what is a "package manager"?
        </h2>

        <p>
        let's start this off with a comparison. you have a phone, right? let's say you have an Android phone.
        on your Android phone, you have an app (most often the Google Play store) that you use to install programs,
        and it also handles updating your programs for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        in linux, that is fundamentally what a package manager is and does. it manages the software on your system.
        because of this, unlike how you'd handle it on Windows, you should install software through your package manager.
        <br>
        <br>
        common package managers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>apt (Debian/Ubuntu family)</li>
            <li>dnf (RHEL family)</li>
            <li>pacman (Arch family)</li>
            <li>nix</li>
            <li>flatpak (a desktop app package manager)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
        these package managers all accomplish the same thing; they manage your software.
        differences between package managers include things like how they handle installing software, what kind of software they handle,
        and their "repositories", which are public databases of software for you to install.
        </p>

        <h2 id="releasecycles">
        2. what is a "release cycle"?
        </h2>

        <p>
        one of the main differences between distributions is their release cycles.
        a release cycle is just how often the main repository for your distribution adopts major updates for software it manages.
        <br>
        some distributions have a long release cycle, such as Debian, which has a major release every 2 years.
        <br>
        some have shorter ones, such as Fedora, which has a major release every 4 months.
        <br>
        some don't have a release cycle at all, such as Arch, which follows a "rolling release" model instead, where all software is always the absolute latest version.
        <br>
        <br>
        the release cycle you want depends on your personal preference. some people don't mind older software and rather not worry about things breaking,
        so they may choose distributions with a longer cycle such as Debian. others are savvy enough to fix things when they do break, and may opt for Arch.
        </p>

        <div class="small-vertical-divider"></div>

        <h2 id="distributions">
        3. what is a "distribution"?
        </h2>

        <p>
        with those two fundamentals out of the way, all that a distribution is, is a collection of default software, and a package manager with a set repository.
        <br>
        <br>
        for example, Linux Mint comes with the apt and flatpak package managers, follows the Ubuntu repositories,
        comes with the Cinnamon desktop environment by default, as well as plenty of other software that you'd expect to see on a regular system such as Firefox.
        <br>
        <br>
        most distributions pick a default desktop environment, but you can swap it out with another by installing it through your package manager
        and changing what desktop environment you will use on the login screen.
        </p>

        <div class="small-vertical-divider"></div>

        <h2 id="gaming">
        4. what about gaming?
        </h2>

        <p>
        for most games, linux is ready. i frequently play demanding games such as Helldivers 2, Warframe, WH40K: Darktide, and Sea of Thieves on linux.
        <br>
        <br>
        if you're worried about whether your game is able to be played on linux, there is <a href="https://protondb.com" target="_blank">protondb</a>.
        protondb is a collection of user reviews and possible configuration steps to get games running smoothly on linux.
        <br>
        <br>
        if the game you want to play isn't available on Steam, know that you can actually add an arbitrary program to Steam and then run it through Proton.
        </p>

        <div class="small-vertical-divider"></div>

        <h2 id="recommendations">
        5. what do you recommend?
        </h2>

        <p>
        i recommend doing a bit of research before picking a distribution. if you don't want to go hunting information, just choose Linux Mint,
        and make sure you don't go hunting program installers online. instead, consult official documentation and guides for how to install things.
        for example, NVidia drivers. Linux Mint comes with an application that handles driver installation for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        you can always play with different distributions in something like Oracle VM VirtualBox before coming to a decision, but, ultimately, if you are brand new,
        you likely have no idea what is and isn't important to you, so you should go with something simple and go from there.
        <br>
        <br>
        if you want to learn more about how linux works to be able to fix things yourself when they go wrong, firstly, do not fear the terminal.
        installing Arch will teach you a lot of how the standard linux installer works under the hood,
        and setting up a full Arch system will teach you a lot of how to manage services under systemd.
        <br>
        <br>
        once you have Linux Mint set up, i strongly recommend setting up Timeshift. Timeshift is a program that fulfills the same purpose as Windows System Restore Points.
        beyond this, don't forget to RTFM using the man command, and understand that linux is a completely different operating system. your workflow will have to change.
