moving forward i will likely be creating more posts. linux guides, various information, word vomit onto a webpage.

**why?** because i no longer need to [write html by hand](https://github.com/jack-avery/jackavery-web/blob/main/roles/deploy/files/web/post/debootstrap_guide.html) for every single post, which, as you can likely imagine, was a massive pain in the ass when all i wanted to do was write.

now this site is using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static page renderer. mostly because my old website had a bunch of defunct or otherwise broken services that i don't really have the time to tend to (between university and work).

wonderful little contraption lets me just write in standard markdown and use my little trinkets to render it into a full webpage.

i still need to add the rest of my old site, primarily my list of projects, but for now, i'm happy knowing making posts about things i want to share will no longer be the result of an hour-long slog of html jank.
